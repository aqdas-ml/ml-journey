# House Price Prediction

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using
property-related features such as size, number of bedrooms, and age.

## Dataset
- Type: Structured tabular dataset
- Features: Size (sqft), Bedrooms, Age
- Target: House Price (continuous value)

## Approach
- Data inspection and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model training using Multiple Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Results
The model achieved a strong R² score, indicating that the selected
features explain most of the variance in house prices.

## Key Learnings
- Building an end-to-end regression pipeline
- Importance of feature scaling in linear models
- Interpretation of regression coefficients
- Role of EDA in model selection
